Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the future, with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers.\n",

Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.\n",
